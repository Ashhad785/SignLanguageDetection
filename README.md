# SignLanguageDetection

Real-time Sign Language Detection using Tensorflow Object Detection API. 

1. A mobilenet-ssd (Single-Shot multibox detection) model implemented using Tensorflow Object detection API and OpenCV. 
2. The model was trained to detect sign language in real time with great accuracy. 
3. This project also involved creation of a custom dataset from scratch using OpenCV and labelImg for the training and testing of the model.
